# Console-TicTacToe-CSharp.NET
This project is written in C# during my semester studies in C# and .Net framework course.
In the project, the UI part separated from the logic part.

The project is the TicTacToe game but oposite (who gets a sequence is the looser), console UI implemented separate from the logic code of the game.
